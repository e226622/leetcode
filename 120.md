# 120
## 120. Triangle
its a classic dp problem


Given a triangle array, return the minimum path sum from top to bottom.

For each step, you may move to an adjacent number of the row below. More formally, if you are on index i on the current row, you may move to either index i or index i + 1 on the next row.

code:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def minimumTotal(self, triangle):
        for i in range(1,len(triangle)):
            for j in range(i+1):
                if j==0:
                    triangle[i][j]+=triangle[i-1][j]
                elif j==len(triangle[i])-1:
                    triangle[i][j]+=triangle[i-1][j-1]
                elif j!=0 and j!=len(triangle[i])-1:
                    b=triangle[i][j]+triangle[i-1][j]
                    c=triangle[i][j]+triangle[i-1][j-1]
                    triangle[i][j]=min(b,c)
        return min(triangle[-1])        
```

my personal understand of dp: in chinese: 见微知著，局部着眼
