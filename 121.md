You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        profit=0
        lp=0
        rp=1
        while rp<len(prices):
            if prices[lp]>prices[rp]:
                lp=rp
                rp+=1
            else:
                profit=max(profit,prices[rp]-prices[lp])
                rp+=1
        return profit
