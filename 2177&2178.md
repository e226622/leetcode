To be honest I think these two problems are submitted by indian because they are more like math problems rather than programming problem

## 2177. Find Three Consecutive Integers That Sum to a Given Number
Given an integer num, return three consecutive integers (as a sorted array) that sum to num. If num cannot be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers, return an empty array  

-------

```python
 class Solution(object):
    def sumOfThree(self, num):
        if num%3==0:
            return [num/3-1,num/3,num/3+1]
        else:
            return[]
```
Its quiet simple because $(n-1)+n+(n+1)=3n$

## 2178. Maximum Split of Positive Even Integers
You are given an integer finalSum. Split it into a sum of a maximum number of unique positive even integers.

For example, given finalSum = 12, the following splits are valid (unique positive even integers summing up to finalSum): (12), (2 + 10), (2 + 4 + 6), and (4 + 8). Among them, (2 + 4 + 6) contains the maximum number of integers. Note that finalSum cannot be split into (2 + 2 + 4 + 4) as all the numbers should be unique.
Return a list of integers that represent a valid split containing a maximum number of integers. If no valid split exists for finalSum, return an empty list. You may return the integers in any order.

-----
```python
class Solution(object):
    def maximumEvenSplit(self, finalSum):
        if finalSum%2!=0:
            return []
        else:
            max=int(finalSum**0.5)+1
            while max*(max+1)>finalSum:
                max+=-1
            lastnum=finalSum-max*(max+1)
            res=list(range(2,2*max+1,2))
            res[-1]+=lastnum
            return res

```
